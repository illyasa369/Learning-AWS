# Load Balancing and Scalability

## Scalability
Scalability - The ability of a system to handle greater loads by scaling.

Two kinds of scaling:
- Vertical Scaling: Increasing the size of the instance.
- Horizontal Scaling: Increasing the number of instances.
<br>

## High Availability
High Availability (HA): The process of keeping systems running even if something fails.

In AWS, HA is achieved by utilizing multiple AZs. If one AZ fails, another takes over.

Two types of HA:
- Passive: One main system and a standby system.
- Active: Multiple systems running at the same time.

## Load Balancers
Load balancers are servers that distribute incoming traffic across multiple downstream servers.

Benefits of using a Load Balancer:
- Spreads traffic across many servers so no server is overwhelmed by traffic.
- Gives one DNS endpoint for users.
- Regular health checks for instances.
- Handles instance failures - Stops sending traffic to unhealthy instances.
- Keeps users on the same servers (sticky sessions).
- Improves availability across AZs.
- Handles HTTPS security.

Benefits of using AWS ELBs:
- Managed service: AWS handles upgrades, maintenance and HA.
- Integration with many AWS services (EC2, ASG, Route 53, CloudWatch).

### Health Checks
Indicates to a load balancer whether a server is operational or not.

- The LB sends a request to a port + path (/health).
- Expects a 200 OK response.
- If a server is unhealthy, the LB stops sending traffic to it.

### Types of Load Balancers on AWS
<br>

### Load Balancer Security Groups
- Classic and Application Load Balancers use security groups.

- Load Balancers and EC2 instances use separate SGs.

- The Load Balancer's SG allows inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (public internet).

- The EC2 instance's SG only allows HTTP traffic from the Load Balancer's SG. This means only the Load Balancer can send HTTP traffic to the EC2 instance, not users directly.
<br>

### Application Load Balancers
- Operates at layer 7.
- Handles HTTP and HTTPS requests.
- Can inspect request content; URL paths, hostnames, headers, query strings and so on.
- Routes traffic to multiple target groups. Targets can be EC2 instances, Containers (ECS) or Lambda functions.
