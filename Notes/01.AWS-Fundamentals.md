# AWS Fundamentals

### AWS
- Cloud platform, pay-as-you-go, flexible.
- Use: apps, storage, automation, compute.
<br>

### Core Services & Concepts

- IAM: Users, groups, security.
- Compute: EC2, containers, clusters.
- Networking: VPCs, subnets, security groups, NACLs.
- Storage: S3, EBS.
- Databases: RDS, Aurora.
<br>

### Global Infrastructure
- Regions: Physical clusters of data centers. Choose by: compliance, proximity, services and pricing.
- AZs (Availability Zones): Isolated data centers in a region; high availability.
- Edge Locations: CDN points; reduce latency, faster content delivery.
<br>

### Best Practices
- Deploy across multiple AZs → resilient apps.
- Pick region close to users → lower latency.
- Check service availability in chosen region.
- Use IAM for secure access control.
