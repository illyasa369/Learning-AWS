# <p align="center">AWS Security Groups</p>
<br>

- Security Groups = virtual firewalls for EC2.
- Control which ports are open and which IPs are allowed.
- Only uses Allow rules.
- If a connection is not allowed, it is blocked.
<br>

## Inbound and Outbound Traffic
- Inbound traffic blocked by default.
- Outbound traffic allowed by default.


#### Security Groups are Stateful: If incoming traffic is allowed, the response is allowed automatically.
<br>

## Security Group Rules
Made of:
  - Protocol
  - Port
  - Source (IP or Other SG)
<br>

## Referencing other SGs
An SG can allow other SGs; instances permitted in the other SG are also permitted.
<br>
<br>

## Good to know
- One SG can be attached to many instances
- SGs are region + VPC specific
- SGs sit outside the EC2 instance
- Timeout = SG issue
- Connection refused = app/instance issue
- Best practice:
  - Separate SG for SSH
  - Open only what you need
